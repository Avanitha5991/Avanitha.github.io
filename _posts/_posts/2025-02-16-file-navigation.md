# 📂 Linux File & Directory Navigation Tricks

## 🚀 Navigating Fast
- `cd -` → Go to the previous directory
- `cd ..` → Move up one level
- `pushd dir/` → Save current directory and switch
- `popd` → Return to the saved directory

## 🛠️ Working with Files
- `touch file.txt` → Create a new file
- `mv file.txt folder/` → Move file to folder
- `rm -rf folder/` → Delete folder and all contents

## ⏳ Viewing Files Faster
- `less filename` → Open large file for reading
- `tail -f logfile` → Watch log file updates in real-time
- `cat file | nl` → Number the lines in a file
