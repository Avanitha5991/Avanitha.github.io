## Introduction to Linux
Welcome to my GitHub Pages blog on Linux commands! This blog is dedicated to sharing detailed notes on various Linux commands, their usage, and practical example.
Linux is a free, open-source operating system based on Unix. It powers everything from personal computers to servers, mobile devices, and cloud computing infrastructure. Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux offers greater flexibility, security, and customization.
1. Kernel: the core of the operating system, manages the hardware resources of the computer

2. Shell: a command line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system (bash, zsh, ksh)

3. Distribution: a version of the Linux operating system that includes the Linux kernel and additional software

### Basics

**Description:** The `echo` command outputs the string that is passed to it as an argument.
**Example:**
